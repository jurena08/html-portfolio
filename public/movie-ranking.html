<h1>Julie's Top 5 Movies of all time</h1>
<h2>Here's a list of my go-to movies.</h2>
<hr />
<br />
<p><h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
This musical classic will always make me feel cheerful and bright while singing along to "The Hills Are Alive", "Do Re Mi" "Edelweiss", among others with the stellar Julie Andrews.</p>
<p><h3>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</h3>
If you say you don't enjoy the first installment of this saga... You're lying. Just Johnny Depp's performance as the hilariously irresponsible drunk Captain Jack Sparrow, garantees a good time for sure.</p>
<p><h3>Shrek 2</h3>
Remember that epic "I need a hero" musical number? That alone is pure animated cinema masterpiece. Let's just say that.</p>
<p><h3>It's Complicated</h3>
This comedy centers around a happily divorced lady who seems to have found her peace: Has a successful food business, her youngest kid is already going to college and her eldest is engaged, and a routine that keeps her centered... Until her ex starts having yet another mid-life crisis and brings her with him. Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin make this movie extremely fun while keeping it relatable for many.</p>
<p><h3>Harry Potter... Any Harry Potter Movie</h3>
As a resident potterhead, couldn't end this list without mentioning this amazing saga that many of us grew up with. The performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and, hello?? THE Ralph Fiennes!! Among many others, have really stood the test of time. Worht to mention: The FX for each one of them were pretty impressive too!</p>
