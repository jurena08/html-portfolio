<p>Let's celebrate doing what I love most: Dancing, eating and drinking!</p>
<h3>Here's what you should know:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We'll have food, cake and drinks, it's on the house!</li>
    <li>Ladies, bring spare comfortable shoes just in case.</li>
    <li>You don't have to be super punctual, but be mindful to not arrive more than an hour later or you'll miss all the fun!</li>
    <li>Come well-rested and with the best attitude.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When and where we'll be celebrating at:</h3>
<p>Saturday February 7th, 8:00 PM. Coucou, Zona Colonial.<br />
