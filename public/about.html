<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a passionate tech support professional with over eight years of experience in customer service, tier 1 technical support, sales development, and client success for SaaS companies. I thrive on helping people navigate technology, solve problems, and optimize their tools to achieve their goals.</p>

 <p>Currently, I'm expanding my expertise by diving into full-stack web development, starting with Python, while also learning French—because why not challenge myself in both tech and language?</p>
</p>
 <p> Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm a huge musical theatre enthusiast, a music lover, and a fan of books, movies, and all things cultural. And when I'm not geeking out over tech or singing show tunes, you'll find me spending quality time with my favorite furry friends—I'm both a cat and a dog person!</p>
  
  <p>Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
